	abstract = {This article provides an overview of different computational options for inference following normal theory maximum likelihood ({ML}) estimation in structural equation modeling ({SEM}) with incomplete normal and nonnormal data. Complete data are covered as a special case. These computational options include whether the information matrix is observed or expected, whether the observed information matrix is estimated numerically or using an analytic asymptotic approximation, and whether the information matrix and the outer product matrix of the score vector are evaluated at the saturated or at the structured estimates. A variety of different standard errors and robust test statistics become possible by varying these options. We review the asymptotic properties of these computational variations, and we show how to obtain them using lavaan in R. We hope that this article will encourage methodologists to study the impact of the available computational options on the performance of standard errors and test statistics in {SEM}.},

	abstract = {"Lauded for its easy-to-understand, conversational discussion of the fundamentals of mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis, this book has been fully revised with 50\% new content, including sections on working with multicategorical antecedent variables, the use of {PROCESS} version 3 for {SPSS} and {SAS} for model estimation, and annotated {PROCESS} v3 outputs. Using the principles of ordinary least squares regression, Andrew F. Hayes carefully explains procedures for testing hypotheses about the conditions under and the mechanisms by which causal effects operate, as well as the moderation of such mechanisms. Hayes shows how to estimate and interpret direct, indirect, and conditional effects; probe and visualize interactions; test questions about moderated mediation; and report different types of analyses. Data for all the examples are available on the companion website ([ital]www.afhayes.com[/ital]), along with links to download {PROCESS}"--},
