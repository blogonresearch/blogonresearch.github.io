	abstract = {Mediation, moderation, and moderated mediation are common in behavioral research models. Several tools are available for estimating indirect effects, conditional effects, and conditional indirect effects and forming their confidence intervals. However, there are no simple-to-use tools that can appropriately form the bootstrapping confidence interval for standardized conditional indirect effects. Moreover, some tools are restricted to a limited type of models. We developed an R package, manymome, which can be used to estimate and form confidence intervals for indirect effects, conditional effects, and conditional indirect effects, standardized or not, using a two-step approach: model parameters are estimated either by structural equation modeling using lavaan or by a set of linear regression models using lm, and then the coefficients are used to compute the requested effects and form confidence intervals. It can be used when there are missing data if the model is fitted by structural equation modeling. There are only a few limitations on some aspects of a model, and no inherent limitations on the number of predictors, the number of independent variables, or the number of moderators and mediators. The goal is to have a tool that allows researchers to focus on model fitting first and worry about estimating the effects later. The use of the model is illustrated using a few numerical examples, and the limitations of the package are discussed.},

	abstract = {Mediation models are often used as a means to explain the psychological mechanisms between an independent and a dependent variable in the behavioral and social sciences. A major limitation of the unstandardized indirect effect calculated from raw scores is that it cannot be interpreted as an effect-size measure. In contrast, the standardized indirect effect calculated from standardized scores can be a good candidate as a measure of effect size because it is scale invariant. In the present article, 11 methods for constructing the confidence intervals (CIs) of the standardized indirect effects were evaluated via a computer simulation. These included six Wald CIs, three bootstrap CIs, one likelihood-based CI, and the PRODCLIN CI. The results consistently showed that the percentile bootstrap, the bias-corrected bootstrap, and the likelihood-based approaches had the best coverage probability. Mplus, LISREL, and Mx syntax were included to facilitate the use of these preferred methods in applied settings. Future issues on the use of the standardized indirect effects are discussed.},
