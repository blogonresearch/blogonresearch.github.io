	abstract = {This article provides an overview of different computational options for inference following normal theory maximum likelihood ({ML}) estimation in structural equation modeling ({SEM}) with incomplete normal and nonnormal data. Complete data are covered as a special case. These computational options include whether the information matrix is observed or expected, whether the observed information matrix is estimated numerically or using an analytic asymptotic approximation, and whether the information matrix and the outer product matrix of the score vector are evaluated at the saturated or at the structured estimates. A variety of different standard errors and robust test statistics become possible by varying these options. We review the asymptotic properties of these computational variations, and we show how to obtain them using lavaan in R. We hope that this article will encourage methodologists to study the impact of the available computational options on the performance of standard errors and test statistics in {SEM}.},
