This is a "revival" of an old blog of mine on psychological research and methodology
 (hence the name *Blogonreseach*). Just anything on research and methodology
 that are useful to me, and maybe also useful to others.

I am still learning how to use [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/),
which may be more suitable than
blogdown because this blog is
for academic and technical stuff and I do not want to spend time
on aesthetic stuff.

As of 2022-08-01, this should be the only "post."
Once I know enough about Distill, I will start adding posts here.
