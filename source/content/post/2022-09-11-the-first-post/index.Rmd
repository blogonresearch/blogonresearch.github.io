This is a "revival" of an old blog of mine on psychological research and methodology
(hence the name *Blogonresearch*). Just anything on research and methodology
that are useful to me, and maybe also useful to others.

I tried `distill`. I liked it. However, there are some problems
with the RSS and so I decided to try `blogdown` and `hugo`, again.
