Just anything on research and methodology that are useful to me, and maybe also useful to others.\r\nThough I called it a “revival,” I will not import posts from the old and now offline blog. Some of the technical stuff on R are outdated. It is a “revival” in the sense that I will do what I did then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
