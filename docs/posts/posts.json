Just anything on research and methodology that are useful to me, and maybe also useful to others.\r\nI am still learning how to use Distill, which may be more suitable than blogdown because this blog is for academic and technical stuff and I do not want to spend time on aesthetic stuff.\r\nAs of 2022-08-01, this should be the only “post.” Once I know enough about Distill, I will start adding posts here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
