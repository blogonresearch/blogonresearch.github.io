This is a "revival" of an old blog of mine on psychological research and methodology
 (hence the name *Blogonreseach*). Just anything on research and methodology
 that are useful to me, and maybe also useful to others.

Though I called it a "revival," I will not import posts from the old and
now offline blog. Some of the technical stuff on `R` are outdated. It is
a "revival" in the sense that I will do what I did then.
